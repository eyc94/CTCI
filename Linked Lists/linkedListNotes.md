# Linked Lists
- Data structure that represents a sequence of nodes.
- In a Singly Linked List, each node points to the next node in the Linked List.
- A Doubly Linked List gives each node pointers to both the next node and the previous node.
- Linked List does not provide constant time access to an index.
- If you'd like to find the Nth element in the list, you need to traverse N elements.
- Benefit is you can add or remove in constant time.
